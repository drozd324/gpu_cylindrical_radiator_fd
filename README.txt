Find the report in the report directory.
Main info in report.pdf

To run all the code necessary compile code in "float" and "double" with a standard
Makefile with "make" and then you can run "bash runall.sh" in the top directory to 
run all code neccesary to produce plots in the report. Then to actually make the plots
int the report run the "task3.py" file in both "double" and "float" and also run 
"comparison.py" in the "comparison_plots" directory.
